snap-python documentation
=========================

Welcome to the documentation site for snap-python.

This is a python package I have created to assist with interacting with the `snapd daemon <https://snapcraft.io/docs/get-started>`_ running on a user's local machine.

This package exposes a async HTTP client, using the `httpx <https://www.python-httpx.org/>`_ library, to interact with the `snapd REST API <https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapd-api>`_.
